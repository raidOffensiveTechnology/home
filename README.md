## Our morals
- We believe that disclosing weaknesses in a system is a must to help improve the system itself
- We believe it is wrong to hack with the intention of monetary gain
- We believe it is wrong for a company/organization to keep originally free software behind a paywall
- We believe it is an obligation to give credit where credit is due

## Our Meetings
We hold our meetings at the Stem Center (Projector Room) at 15:00 every Thursday.
